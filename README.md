## Data Structures Practice
### Overview
This repository stores **C** implementations of important **DATA STRUCTURES**. 
These we completed either as an assignment for a CS class, or for personal practice and curiosity. 
Most implementations are very simple and were written so that I could better understand how each structure behaves “under the hood”. 

Contributions to this repository are iterative, as its primary focus is to serve as a learning module were I can continuously 
expand my knowledge on newfound new data structures that I wish to implement myself or better understand.

Note: While the majority of the code is mine, for some of the labs or homework assignments I received help from the class’s TAs and instructor.
